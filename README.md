The vision is a shell in the browser with suggestions to the user on next steps.
First create a wall and a note. The wall in itself only is a reference to the first screen the user saw when they were running the game on their machine.

Clicking on an address the user sees the following picture in their browser. 

```shell
/ Today is the 63rd of The Aftermath    \
| 3189. You are standing west of house. |
\ There is a note at the wall.          /
 --------------------------------------- 
        \   ^__^

                ||----w |
                ||     ||

The user is expected to type `help`, `view_note`, or any of the avaliable commands to get to a new location: blog, contact info, IoT mesh, etc.
